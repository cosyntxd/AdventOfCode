# Advent of Code
my personal repo for [aoc](https://adventofcode.com/2024)

# What is Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an advent calendar for programmers. For 25 days during december, programmers come together to solve some fun puzzles in any programming language you like as long as it is rust. Advent of Code is created by Eric Wastl, and is 100% free. If you enjoy it feel free to donate to him.

# About this repo
I am trying to restructure everything to be a general comp programming repo so there is only `aoc/`

`src/runner` a fun library that makes solving aoc quicker (spent more time on this than the puzzles)

`src/*` my solutions for that year

`data/` auto downloaded day inputs

`build.rs` black magic to auo generate stuff
